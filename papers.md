| **Pelletier et al., 2012 – Physical manipulation of the *E. coli* chromosome reveals its soft nature** | Bacterial chromosome behaves as a soft, loaded entropic spring; small forces (~100 pN) compress to in vivo size; compaction–decompaction driven by crowding. | Microfluidic "mother machine", optical trap micropiston, fluorescence imaging, PCA shape analysis. | Extend force–compression mapping to live-cell conditions; probe torque response; add high-speed 3D imaging. | Measure damping/viscoelasticity of confined DNA; test polymer theory under active forcing. | How does confinement modify the entropic spring constant of a long worm-like chain polymer compared to free-solution predictions? |
| **Zhang et al., 2019 – Manipulating rod-shaped bacteria with optical tweezers** | Stable trapping of live *E. coli* with minimal photodamage; oscillating traps give ~2.5× higher IR dose tolerance; optimized geometry for viability. | Optical tweezers (stationary & oscillating), microfluidics, brightfield & fluorescence imaging, viability assays. | Integrate oscillating trapping with in-channel lysis for DNA manipulation without sample relocation. | Hold cells during on-chip lysis, then directly manipulate genomic DNA for mechanical testing. | Can oscillating traps reduce hydrodynamic drag and photodamage enough to measure polymer relaxation times for confined bacterial DNA? |
| **Wu et al., 2019 – Cell boundary confinement sets size and position of the *E. coli* chromosome** | Chromosome size scales nonlinearly with cell size; mid-cell positioning robust; crowding/confinement drive compaction. | Microfabricated channels, division inhibition for long cells, HU–mYPet labeling, osmotic shock, MD simulations. | Test confinement in narrower channels; vary crowding agents; link to mechanical measurements. | Combine force spectroscopy with confinement–crowding modulation to map force–size relationship. | What scaling laws govern polymer coil–globule transitions for bacterial DNA under combined crowding and confinement? |
| **Kabtiyal et al., 2024 – Localized plasmonic heating for single-molecule DNA rupture measurements in optical tweezers** | Demonstrated nanometer-scale, wavelength-selective plasmonic heating via 15 nm AuNPs; localized heating accelerates DNA shear-rupture under constant force; revealed temperature dependence of rupture reaction coordinate. | Dual-trap optical tweezers (C-Trap), plasmonic heating with AuNPs, single-molecule fluorescence, microfluidics, WLC fitting. | Extend to longer DNA constructs; apply to DNA–protein complexes; couple heating with mechanical manipulation for controlled denaturation. | Use plasmonic heating to probe force–temperature phase diagram of confined bacterial genomic DNA in microchannels. | How does local nanoscale heating alter the effective elasticity and rupture kinetics of a polymer under confinement and force load? |
| **Liu et al., 2021 – Effect of inoculum size and antibiotics on bacterial traveling bands in thin microchannels** | Chemotactic traveling bands depend on inoculum size and antibiotic exposure; sub-MIC antibiotics can enhance chemotaxis despite growth inhibition; antibiotics cause morphological changes (e.g., filamentation) that affect motility. | Quasi-2D optical adhesive microchannels, phase-contrast microscopy, custom image processing, bacterial trajectory tracking, statistical motility analysis. | Integrate 3D tracking and high-resolution force measurements; connect chemotaxis changes to chromosome mechanics; couple motility to in-channel lysis. | Use in-channel motility analysis as a precursor to optical tweezer-based DNA mechanics experiments post-lysis. | How does polymeric DNA confinement and structural change under stress (antibiotic, crowding) influence active transport and migration dynamics of the whole cell? |
