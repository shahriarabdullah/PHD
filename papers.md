| **Pelletier et al., 2012 – Physical manipulation of the *E. coli* chromosome reveals its soft nature** | Bacterial chromosome behaves as a soft, loaded entropic spring; small forces (~100 pN) sufficient to compress it to in vivo size; rapid, reversible compaction–decompaction driven by crowding. | Microfluidic "mother machine", optical trap–based micropiston, fluorescence imaging (HU–mCherry), PCA shape analysis. | Extend force–compression mapping to live-cell conditions; integrate high-speed 3D imaging; probe torque response. | Measure damping and viscoelastic properties of confined DNA; test polymer theory predictions under active forcing. | How does confinement modify the entropic spring constant of a long worm-like chain polymer compared to free-solution predictions? |
| **Zhang et al., 2019 – Manipulating rod-shaped bacteria with optical tweezers** | Established stable trapping of live *E. coli* with minimal photodamage; oscillating traps allow ~2.5× higher IR dose tolerance than stationary traps; optimized trap geometry for long-term viability. | Optical tweezers (stationary & oscillating), microfluidics, brightfield & fluorescence microscopy, cell viability assays. | Combine oscillating trapping with in-channel lysis to transition from whole-cell to chromosome manipulation without moving sample. | Use optimized oscillating trap to hold cells during on-chip lysis, then directly manipulate genomic DNA for mechanical testing. | Can oscillating optical traps reduce hydrodynamic drag and photodamage enough to measure polymer relaxation times for confined bacterial DNA? |
| **Wu et al., 2019 – Cell boundary confinement sets size and position of the *E. coli* chromosome** | Chromosome size scales nonlinearly with cell size; positioning robust at mid-cell (1/4 & 3/4 for sisters); crowding and confinement drive compaction. | Microfabricated channels, long-cell growth via division inhibition, HU–mYPet labeling, osmotic shock, molecular dynamics simulations. | Test confinement effect in narrower microchannels; vary crowding agents in situ; link to mechanical measurements. | Combine force spectroscopy (optical tweezers) with confinement–crowding modulation to map force–size relationship in real time. | What scaling laws govern polymer coil–globule transitions for bacterial DNA under combined crowding and microchannel confinement? |
