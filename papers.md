| **Pelletier et al., 2012 – Physical manipulation of the *E. coli* chromosome reveals its soft nature** | Bacterial chromosome behaves as a soft, loaded entropic spring; small forces (~100 pN) compress to in vivo size; compaction–decompaction driven by crowding. | Microfluidic "mother machine", optical trap micropiston, fluorescence imaging, PCA shape analysis. | Extend force–compression mapping to live-cell conditions; probe torque response; add high-speed 3D imaging. | Measure damping/viscoelasticity of confined DNA; test polymer theory under active forcing. | How does confinement modify the entropic spring constant of a long worm-like chain polymer compared to free-solution predictions? |
| **Zhang et al., 2019 – Manipulating rod-shaped bacteria with optical tweezers** | Stable trapping of live *E. coli* with minimal photodamage; oscillating traps give ~2.5× higher IR dose tolerance; optimized geometry for viability. | Optical tweezers (stationary & oscillating), microfluidics, brightfield & fluorescence imaging, viability assays. | Integrate oscillating trapping with in-channel lysis for DNA manipulation without sample relocation. | Hold cells during on-chip lysis, then directly manipulate genomic DNA for mechanical testing. | Can oscillating traps reduce hydrodynamic drag and photodamage enough to measure polymer relaxation times for confined bacterial DNA? |
| **Wu et al., 2019 – Cell boundary confinement sets size and position of the *E. coli* chromosome** | Chromosome size scales nonlinearly with cell size; mid-cell positioning robust; crowding/confinement drive compaction. | Microfabricated channels, division inhibition for long cells, HU–mYPet labeling, osmotic shock, MD simulations. | Test confinement in narrower channels; vary crowding agents; link to mechanical measurements. | Combine force spectroscopy with confinement–crowding modulation to map force–size relationship. | What scaling laws govern polymer coil–globule transitions for bacterial DNA under combined crowding and confinement? |
| **Kabtiyal et al., 2024 – Localized plasmonic heating for single-molecule DNA rupture measurements in optical tweezers** | Demonstrated nanometer-scale, wavelength-selective plasmonic heating via 15 nm AuNPs; localized heating accelerates DNA shear-rupture under constant force; revealed temperature dependence of rupture reaction coordinate. | Dual-trap optical tweezers (C-Trap), plasmonic heating with AuNPs, single-molecule fluorescence, microfluidics, WLC fitting. | Extend to longer DNA constructs; apply to DNA–protein complexes; couple heating with mechanical manipulation for controlled denaturation. | Use plasmonic heating to probe force–temperature phase diagram of confined bacterial genomic DNA in microchannels. | How does local nanoscale heating alter the effective elasticity and rupture kinetics of a polymer under confinement and force load? |
| **Persson & Tegenfeldt, 2010 – DNA in nanochannels: directly visualizing genomic information** | Stretching DNA in nanochannels enables coarse-grained genome mapping with high reproducibility; confinement physics follows de Gennes/Odijk scaling; ionic strength & crowding modulate extension. | Nanofluidic channels, fluorescence microscopy, restriction/nick translation mapping, polymer theory modeling. | Integrate optical tweezers for force spectroscopy inside nanochannels; couple mapping with mechanical perturbation. | Manipulate DNA in nanochannels using tweezers to correlate mechanical elasticity with genomic mapping precision. | How does controlled force perturbation alter extension scaling and fluctuation statistics for confined polymers? |
| **Frykholm et al., 2022 – DNA in nanochannels: theory and applications** | Comprehensive review of DNA polymer physics in nanochannels; clarifies scaling regimes (de Gennes, Odijk, extended de Gennes), hairpin/backfolding effects; outlines genomic mapping & DNA–protein interaction applications. | Polymer theory analysis, scaling law derivation, nanofabrication strategies, optical DNA mapping, protein-binding assays in nanochannels. | Apply telegraph model & confinement theory to live bacterial genomic DNA; link fluctuation statistics to force–response. | Combine tweezers + nanochannel confinement to test predicted scaling in intermediate regimes and under crowding. | Can force–extension measurements in confinement discriminate between extended de Gennes and backfolded Odijk regimes for bacterial genome-sized polymers? |
